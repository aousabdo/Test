The Binomial Distribution
-------------------------

The binomial distribution describes the outcome of an experiment where the outocme can take one of two possible values. 
The two possible values for the outcome are things like pass/fail, hit/miss, success/fail, and so forth.  

For an experiment with `n` independent trials where the probability of success is `p`, the probability of having `x` 
successful outocome in the experiment is given by the probability mass function:  


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & = {n \choose x} \, p^x \, (1-p)^{n-x} \,\, \mbox{   for  } x=0, 1, 2, ..., n\\
\mbox{ where }{n \choose x} & = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \mbox{ is the binomial coefficient}
\end{aligned}
$$

The binomial coefficient represents the number of different ways one can have `x` successes in `n` trials.  

This app calculates the probability of success given a number of shots and a number of failures as a function of 
the proportion defective.
